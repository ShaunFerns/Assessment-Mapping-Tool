You are building a small but polished Python/Flask web app that lets TU Dublin programme teams map their assessments across a semester and automatically generate visualisations similar to the three images provided (assessment heatmap, triangle timeline, and outcome matrix).

The app is standalone, no login/auth for now, and will be used live with TU Dublin programme teams, so the UI must be clean, robust, and intuitive.

Use a similar layout/style to an existing DELTA tool (Flask + templates), but with TU Dublin colours: navy and teal as primary colours. Do not use any JavaScript frameworks; use simple JS only where necessary.

1. Tech stack and dependencies

Create a Flask app with:

Flask

pandas (for simple tabular transforms if needed)

python-dotenv (optional)

No database for now: store everything in memory using Python lists/dicts. Structure code so that later we can swap to a database.

Create requirements.txt with (at minimum):

Flask==3.0.3
pandas==2.2.2


(Adjust versions if needed, but pin them.)

2. File and folder structure

Set up this structure:

.
├─ app.py
├─ requirements.txt
├─ static/
│  ├─ css/
│  │  └─ style.css
│  └─ img/
├─ templates/
│  ├─ base.html
│  ├─ home.html
│  ├─ programme_form.html
│  ├─ module_form.html
│  ├─ assessment_form.html
│  ├─ assessment_list.html
│  ├─ visual_triangle.html
│  └─ visual_heatmap.html


You can add helper modules (e.g. models.py) if you prefer, but keep it simple.

3. Data model (in memory for MVP)

Represent everything as Python dicts in memory (global variables in app.py):

programme = {"name": str, "weeks": int}

Only one programme is needed for MVP.

Default weeks = 14.

modules = [] (list of module dicts)
Each module:

{
    "id": int,
    "code": str,
    "title": str
}


assessments = [] (list of assessment dicts)
Each assessment:

{
    "id": int,
    "module_id": int,
    "week": int,               # 1..programme["weeks"]
    "weight": int,             # percentage
    "atype": str,              # "delivery", "presentation", "exam", "report", "casestudy"
    "mode": str,               # "group" or "individual"
    "plo": str,                # Programme Learning Outcomes (free text)
    "mlo": str,                # Module Learning Outcomes (free text)
    "ga": str                  # Graduate Attribute (free text e.g. People / Planet / Partnership)
}


Use a simple integer counter for IDs.

4. Routes and views

Implement these routes:

GET / – Home

Shows a short explanation of the tool’s purpose (TU Dublin assessment mapping).

Buttons/links to:

“Set programme details”

“Manage modules”

“Add assessments”

“View visualisations”

GET, POST /programme

Form fields:

Programme name

Number of weeks (default 14)

POST saves to the global programme dict.

After save, redirect to /modules.

GET, POST /modules

Lists existing modules in a table.

Form at top or separate page to add a module:

Module code

Module title

POST adds a new module to modules.

Provide a “Delete” button for each module (simple remove in memory is fine).

GET, POST /assessments

Displays:

A form to add a new assessment.

A table listing existing assessments.

Form fields:

Module (dropdown from modules)

Week (integer 1..programme["weeks"])

Weighting (%)

Assessment type (select: Delivery, Presentation, Exam, Report, Case Study)

Mode (radio: Group / Individual)

Programme Learning Outcome (PLO) – textarea

Module Learning Outcome (MLO) – textarea

Graduate Attribute (GA) – input text (for now; e.g. People/Planet/Partnership)

POST creates assessment and redirects back to /assessments.

GET /visualisations

Simple page with buttons/links:

“Triangle timeline view” → /visual/triangle

“Assessment heatmap view” → /visual/heatmap

GET /visual/triangle

Renders the triangle timeline visual (see section 5 below).

GET /visual/heatmap

Renders a simpler block timeline / heatmap using coloured rectangles per assessment (see section 6).

No export buttons are required for this MVP; the browser print/export to PDF is fine. Leave hooks (empty buttons) where export could be added later.

5. Triangle timeline visual (visual_triangle.html)

Goal: approximate the third uploaded image.

Layout:

Vertical axis: modules (one row per module).

Horizontal axis: weeks 1..programme["weeks"].

For each module:

Draw a horizontal navy bar spanning all weeks (or the defined weeks).

For each assessment in that module:

Draw a triangle marker positioned above the bar at the appropriate week.

Inside the triangle, show the weighting %.

Beneath or around the triangle, display three small text labels for:

PLO

MLO

GA

A small coloured circle in the triangle or directly behind it shows the assessment type.

The bar line style below the marker reflects mode:

Solid outline for Group

Dashed outline for Individual

Implementation detail (keep it simple):

Use HTML + CSS, not a plotting library.

Use a CSS grid:

One grid column per week.

One grid row per module.

For each assessment:

Place a container div in the appropriate grid cell.

In that container, create the triangle using CSS:

Easiest approach: an SVG element (<svg> with a <polygon>).

Inside SVG, place the percentage text.

Outside/around the triangle (below it), place three inline labels:

“PLO: …”

“MLO: …”

“GA: …”
These can be truncated with CSS (ellipsis) if long.

At the bottom of the page, include a legend with:

A navy rectangle labelled “Delivery”

A red circle labelled “Presentation”

A green circle labelled “Exam”

A yellow circle labelled “Report”

A dark blue circle labelled “Case study”

A solid line labelled “Group”

A dashed line labelled “Individual”

You do not have to exactly match colours from the screenshot, but:

Backgrounds and main bars should use TU Dublin navy and teal.

Accent colours can be used for the circles.

6. Assessment heatmap view (visual_heatmap.html)

Goal: approximate the second image (block layout).

Layout:

Vertical axis: modules (one per row).

Horizontal axis: weeks 1..programme["weeks"].

For each assessment:

Draw a coloured block spanning one week (one column) in the appropriate module row.

The block shows:

Week + weighting (e.g. “WK 7: 50% Exam – Group”).

Short text within the block can include some or all of:

GA

PLO / MLO cues.

Use CSS grid again: rows = modules, columns = weeks.

Colour mapping:

Delivery: navy block

Presentation: red block

Exam: green block

Report: yellow block

Case study: purple block

Add a legend similar to above.

7. Base template and styling

templates/base.html:

Use a simple top navigation bar with TU Dublin navy background and white text:

App title: “TU Dublin Assessment Mapping Tool”

Links: Home, Programme, Modules, Assessments, Visualisations.

Include a content block:

<div class="container">
    {% block content %}{% endblock %}
</div>


static/css/style.css:

Define colours (approximate TU Dublin palette):

:root {
    --tu-navy: #003B5C;
    --tu-teal: #00A6A6;
    --tu-light-bg: #f5f7fa;
    --accent-red: #e74c3c;
    --accent-green: #27ae60;
    --accent-yellow: #f1c40f;
    --accent-purple: #6c5ce7;
}


Body:

sans-serif font (e.g. system font stack).

light background.

.navbar:

background: var(--tu-navy);

text: white.

Buttons and primary actions:

background: var(--tu-teal);

hover: darker teal or navy.

Tables and forms:

clean, minimal borders.

Grid for timelines:

Use display: grid.

Light grey vertical grid lines to mark weeks.

Module labels aligned left in a fixed column.

Aim for a clean, professional academic dashboard look.

8. UX details

After creating programme, modules, or assessments, redirect to the relevant listing page with a simple Bootstrap-style flash message (you can implement your own basic message styling).

Validate forms minimally:

Week must be within 1..programme["weeks"].

Weighting must be 0–100.

Module list must not be empty when adding assessments.

If there is no programme yet, show a warning on pages that require it and link users to /programme.

9. Testing checklist

Before finishing:

Start the app with python app.py.

Set a programme: name “MSc Management S1” and 14 weeks.

Add 3–4 modules.

Add several assessments across different weeks and modules, with mixed types and modes.

Confirm:

Assessments appear correctly in the list.

Triangle timeline shows one row per module and triangles in the correct week.

Heatmap view shows coloured blocks for each assessment.

Legends appear and make sense.

Navigation works across pages.

Make sure the app runs without errors in Replit.
