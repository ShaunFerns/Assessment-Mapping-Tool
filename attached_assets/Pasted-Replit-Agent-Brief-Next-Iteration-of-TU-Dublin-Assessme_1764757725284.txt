Replit Agent Brief – Next Iteration of TU Dublin Assessment Tool

You are extending an existing Flask app that already:

Captures programme, modules, and assessments

Draws triangle timelines, heatmaps, and an analytics page

Looks visually clean and uses TU Dublin navy/teal

Keep existing visual and code style. This brief adds three high-level enhancements:

Support large programmes gracefully

Improve mobile layout (no overlapping controls)

Add a PLO coverage visual using the PLO/MLO mapping we already collect

1. Make the tool work well for large programmes (e.g. 48 modules)

Goal: avoid one giant unreadable grid. Programme teams should be able to work with:

~6 modules per semester

up to 8 semesters (4 stages × 2 semesters)

What to do

Extend the module model
Add simple fields to each module:

stage (integer, e.g. 1–4)

semester (integer or string, e.g. 1/2 or A/B)

Add filters to visualisation pages
On the visualisations pages (triangle, heatmap, analytics):

Add dropdowns at the top (controls area):

Stage: All, 1, 2, 3, 4

Semester: All, 1, 2 (or A/B – match what you already use)

When filters are set, only include modules (and their assessments) that match the selected stage/semester.

Default behaviour

When the programme has many modules:

Default to Stage 1, Semester 1 on first load.

Provide “All stages / all semesters” options, but don’t default to “All” if there are more than, say, 10 modules, to avoid the mega-grid problem.

This lets a 48-module programme be viewed in manageable slices, while analytics can still aggregate the whole programme when needed.

2. Improve mobile layout (no overlapping text/buttons)

Goal: the app should be usable on phones without elements overlapping, especially on programme visualisation pages.

What to do

Controls bar responsive layout

Wrap the main filters/buttons at the top of visualisation pages in a flex container.

Desktop:

controls in a single row with gaps.

Mobile (e.g. < 768px):

same controls stack vertically (column layout) so buttons and select elements never overlap.

Scrollable timeline / heatmap

Ensure the main timeline/heatmap grid is placed in a wrapper that:

allows horizontal scrolling (overflow-x: auto)

has a minimum width so columns don’t get squashed too small.

This avoids shrinking fonts too much on mobile and keeps the grid readable.

Chart cards responsive layout

On the analytics page, keep the card layout:

Desktop: multiple columns (using CSS grid like now).

Mobile: single column (one chart per row) so charts never overlap text.

The aim is to keep the existing look and feel, just with responsive tweaks: flex-wrap, media queries, and scrollable containers where needed.

3. Add a PLO coverage visual (replace the spreadsheet view)

Goal: programme teams currently use a spreadsheet to show:

Which modules cover which Programme Learning Outcomes (PLOs)

How assessments map to PLOs and MLOs

We are already collecting PLO/MLO mapping per assessment. Use that to add a PLO coverage visual.

3.1 Data assumptions / prep

Assume that for each assessment we already store:

assessment["plo"] → one or more PLO codes (e.g. "PLO1, PLO3")

assessment["mlo"] → one or more MLO codes (e.g. "MLO1, MLO2" or similar)

If they are currently free text:

For this step, you can treat them as comma-separated codes, trimming whitespace and ignoring empty values.

Derive:

A sorted unique list of PLO codes used in the programme.

A mapping of module → which PLOs appear in its assessments.

3.2 New visual: PLO vs Module coverage heatmap

Add a new tab/section under Visualisations (or inside the Analytics page) called:

“PLO Coverage”

Behaviour

Filters (top of page):

Stage (All/1–4)

Semester (All/1–2)

Show a matrix / heatmap with:

Rows: PLO codes (e.g. PLO1, PLO2, …)

Columns: module codes (e.g. MOD101, MOD201, etc.)

Cell value: number of assessments in that module mapped to that PLO
(or total weighting, if you prefer that – choose one and keep it consistent.)

Visual

Use Plotly (or a simple HTML table with conditional colouring).

Colour intensity increases as the count/weight increases:

0 = blank or very light

1+ = progressively stronger colour

Add a short text explanation above the chart so programme teams know:

“Each cell shows how many assessments in that module are mapped to this PLO.”

Integration

Link to this visual from:

/visual/analytics (e.g. a “View PLO coverage heatmap” button), or

As a sixth card on the Analytics page if screen space allows.

This directly replaces the spreadsheet people currently build by hand.

4. Keep everything else as-is

Don’t remove existing visuals (triangle, heatmap, analytics).

Don’t change the overall colour scheme or layout beyond the mobile/responsive tweaks.

Keep using the current unit tests pattern, and add tests only for new helper functions if you create them (e.g. PLO aggregation).
